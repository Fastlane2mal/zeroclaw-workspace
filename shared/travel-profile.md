- ## Travel Personality Notes
  
  *Things Joy should know about how we travel*
- We prefer morning flights (get there, start exploring)
- We like having breakfast included in accommodation
- We're fine with budget airlines (Ryanair, easyJet) for short flights
- We'd rather spend on good meals than fancy hotels
- We enjoy walking around cities — happy to cover 10-15km/day
- We're not early-birds — 9am start is fine, no 6am alarms on holiday
- We like one "nice dinner" mid-trip but mostly casual eating
- We appreciate having one "do nothing" day on longer trips

- ## Things We've Learned
  
  *Travel lessons from experience*
  
  1. **Book accommodation near public transport** — saves time and stress
  2. **Research restaurant hours** — Spain/Portugal lunch times caught us out
  3. **Pack less than you think** — always overpack
  4. **One museum per day max** — museum fatigue is real
  5. **Check Monday closures** — lots of attractions close Mondays
  6. **Download offline maps** — data roaming isn't always reliable
  7. **Bring comfortable shoes** — fashion shoes were a mistake in Lisbon
