- ## Notes for Ziggy
- Prioritise gigs within travelling distance of South Shields — Newcastle and 
  Sunderland are the nearest major venues, but Malcolm may travel further for 
  the right act
- The artists above are the core watchlist — alert immediately if any are touring
- Expand recommendations to similar artists in the folk/acoustic and rock/indie 
  space — think artists that fans of the above would love
- Lindisfarne have a strong North East connection — local tribute acts or 
  anniversary events may also be of interest
