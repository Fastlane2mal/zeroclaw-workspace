## Notes for Ziggy

- Prioritise gigs within travelling distance of South Shields — Newcastle and 
  Sunderland are the nearest major venues, but Malcolm may travel further for 
  the right act
- The artists above are the core watchlist — alert immediately if any are touring
- Expand recommendations to similar artists in the folk/acoustic and rock/indie 
  space — think artists that fans of the above would love
- Lindisfarne have a strong North East connection — local tribute acts or 
  anniversary events may also be of interest

## Notes for Penny

- Malcolm's taste runs toward folk, acoustic, and classic rock/indie
- Song writing lessons should be grounded in these genres where possible
- Artists above can be used as reference points for style, structure, and lyrical 
  approach
