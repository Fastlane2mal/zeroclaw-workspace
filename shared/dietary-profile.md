## Notes for Frank

- Never serve raw tomatoes — roasted, tinned, or cooked forms are all fine
- Avoid uncooked cheese in any dish (e.g. no cheese boards, no cold cheese in salads)
- Melted, baked, or cooked cheese (e.g. lasagne, pizza, grilled) is fine for Jen
- Breakfasts for Malcolm should favour granola-based options over porridge
- Always plan for two portions
