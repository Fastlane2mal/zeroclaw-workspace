# Daily Exercise Tips for Active Living (Age 70+)

## 3 Tips for Staying Active Daily

### 1. **Low-Impact Aerobic Activity**
- Aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week (about 30 minutes, 5 days a week)
- Great options: brisk walking, swimming, cycling, or water aerobics
- These activities strengthen your heart and improve endurance without stressing joints

### 2. **Strength Training 2x Per Week**
- Focus on light resistance exercises to maintain muscle mass and bone density
- Examples: bodyweight exercises, resistance bands, or light dumbbells
- Even 10-15 minutes helps maintain independence and balance
- Always warm up first and consider working with a trainer initially

### 3. **Balance & Flexibility Work Daily**
- Include gentle stretching, yoga, or tai chi to prevent falls
- Practice standing on one leg while brushing teeth or doing light activities
- Improved balance reduces injury risk and maintains mobility
- Flexibility work helps with daily activities like reaching and bending
