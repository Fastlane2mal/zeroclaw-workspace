**Adults:** **1.5 to 2 liters (6-8 glasses) of fluid per day**

This translates to approximately:
- 8-10 glasses or mugs per day (assuming 200-250ml per glass/mug)
- About 2.45 liters for a 70kg person (according to NHS guidelines)

### Important Notes on Daily Intake

1. **Individual Variation**: Water needs vary significantly between individuals based on:
   - Age
   - Sex
   - Body weight
   - Activity level
   - Climate and weather conditions
   - Overall health status
   - Pregnancy and breastfeeding status

2. **Sources of Fluid Intake**:
   - **Beverages**: Approximately 70-80% of daily water needs come from drinks
   - **Food**: The remaining 20-30% comes from foods such as:
     - Soups and stews
     - Fruits (watermelon, oranges, etc.)
     - Vegetables (cucumbers, lettuce, etc.)
     - Other water-rich foods

3. **Types of Drinks That Count**:
   - Plain water (the healthiest choice)
   - Tea and coffee
   - Milk and dairy drinks
   - Juice
   - Other beverages (though water is recommended)

### Hydration Indicators

**The best indicator of good hydration is urine color:**
- **Pale straw color** = Well-hydrated ✓
- **Dark yellow or amber** = Dehydrated, drink more water ✗

Most people should aim to drink enough during the day so their urine is a clear, pale yellow color.
