# Silverblue AI Platform

## What This Project Is
A self-hosted AI platform running on a dedicated headless server (no monitor, accessed via SSH). It gives you access to free local AI models and fast cloud AI models through a single web interface, accessible from anywhere via VPN.

## Goal
Run a personal AI assistant that is private, free to use, and accessible remotely — without relying on expensive subscriptions.

- **Completion**: 7 of 10 success criteria met (~70%)
