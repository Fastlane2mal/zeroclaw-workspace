# Silverblue AI Platform — Logseq Pages

## What's in This Folder

These are ready-to-use Logseq pages for the Silverblue AI Platform project. Copy them into your Logseq graph's `pages` folder to import everything at once.

## Files Included

| File | What It Contains |
|---|---|
| `Silverblue AI Platform.md` | Hub page — start here, links to everything |
| `Hardware.md` | Server specs, storage layout, performance expectations |
| `Architecture.md` | How the system is designed, 4-layer stack, data flow |
| `Services.md` | Every running service: what it does, ports, start/stop commands |
| `Commands Reference.md` | All useful commands organised by task |
| `Decisions.md` | Key choices made and why — read before changing anything |
| `Known Issues.md` | Active issues and resolved issues for reference |
| `Session Log.md` | Full history of all 21 sessions + template for future sessions |

## How to Import Into Logseq

1. Open Logseq on your Windows 11 PC
2. Open your Silverblue AI Platform graph (or create one)
3. Find the graph's folder on disk — usually shown in Settings → Graph
4. Copy all these `.md` files into the `pages` subfolder inside that graph folder
5. Switch back to Logseq — the pages will appear automatically
6. Open "Silverblue AI Platform" as your starting page

## How AnythingLLM Reads Your Pages (Automatic)

Your Logseq graph is saved to `F:\Projects\SilverblueAI\` which is the Samba share
mapped from `/mnt/hdd/share/` on the server. AnythingLLM has that entire share mounted
directly, so it can read your pages without any manual uploading.

**First-time setup in AnythingLLM:**
1. SSH tunnel to your server: `ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 silverblue-ai`
2. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
3. Create a workspace called "Silverblue AI Platform"
4. Click the document icon → browse to `hotdir/Projects/SilverblueAI/pages/`
5. Select all the `.md` files and assign them to the workspace
6. Test with a question like "What services are running on the server?"

That's a one-time step per project. After that, updates are automatic.

## Keeping Things in Sync

No manual syncing needed. The workflow is:
1. Edit a page in Logseq on Windows
2. Logseq saves the file to F:\
3. AnythingLLM reads the updated file directly from the server

The only manual step is when you create a **brand new page** — you'll need to assign it
to the workspace in AnythingLLM once. After that first assignment, updates sync automatically.

## Adding a New Project

No server changes needed. For each new project:
1. Create a new Logseq graph saved to a folder on F:\
2. In AnythingLLM, create a new workspace
3. Browse to that project's pages folder in the hotdir library
4. Assign the files to the new workspace
