# Silverblue AI Platform — Logseq Pages

## What's in This Folder

These are ready-to-use Logseq pages for the Silverblue AI Platform project. Copy them into your Logseq graph's `pages` folder to import everything at once.

## Files Included

| File | What It Contains |
|---|---|
| `Silverblue AI Platform.md` | Hub page — start here, links to everything |
| `Hardware.md` | Server specs, storage layout, performance expectations |
| `Architecture.md` | How the system is designed, 4-layer stack, data flow |
| `Services.md` | Every running service: what it does, ports, start/stop commands |
| `Commands Reference.md` | All useful commands organised by task |
| `Decisions.md` | Key choices made and why — read before changing anything |
| `Known Issues.md` | Active issues and resolved issues for reference |
| `Session Log.md` | Full history of all 21 sessions + template for future sessions |

## How to Import Into Logseq

1. Open Logseq on your Windows 11 PC
2. Open your Silverblue AI Platform graph (or create one)
3. Find the graph's folder on disk — usually shown in Settings → Graph
4. Copy all these `.md` files into the `pages` subfolder inside that graph folder
5. Switch back to Logseq — the pages will appear automatically
6. Open "Silverblue AI Platform" as your starting page

## How to Upload to AnythingLLM

1. SSH tunnel to your server: `ssh -L 3001:localhost:3001 silverblue-ai`
2. Open http://localhost:3001 in your browser
3. Create a workspace called "Silverblue AI Platform"
4. Click Upload Documents
5. Navigate to this folder and upload all the `.md` files
6. Wait for processing (under a minute per file)
7. Test with a question like "What services are running on the server?"

## Keeping Things in Sync

After each session:
1. Update the relevant Logseq pages (especially Session Log)
2. Re-upload only the pages you changed to AnythingLLM
3. Use the "Replace" option when re-uploading to update existing documents
