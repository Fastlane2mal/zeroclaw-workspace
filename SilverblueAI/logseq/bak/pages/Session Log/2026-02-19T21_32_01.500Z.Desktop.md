## Session History Summary

### Sessions 1–5 — Initial VM Deployment
**What happened**: Proved the concept worked in a VirtualBox virtual machine before touching real hardware.
- Installed Fedora Silverblue in VM
- Got Ollama running with local AI models
- Established the container-based service pattern
- Learned: immutable OS requires containers, not package installs

### Sessions 6–8 — Hardware Migration
**What happened**: Moved from VM to the physical laptop server.
- Installed Silverblue on the SSD
- Configured HDD mount using UUID (critical lesson learned here)
- Set up SSH key authentication
- Set up Samba file sharing
- Learned: always use UUIDs in fstab, never device names

### Sessions 9–11 — LiteLLM Integration
**What happened**: Added the unified API gateway so one endpoint works for all models.
- Installed LiteLLM as a Podman container
- Connected Ollama through LiteLLM
- Set up Tailscale VPN for remote access
- Learned: EnvironmentFile must be in [Container] section of quadlet, not [Service]

### Sessions 12–14 — OpenClaw Failure (Database Deadlock)
**What happened**: Attempted to deploy OpenClaw (an AI agent framework with Telegram bot). Failed badly.
- Added Postgres database to LiteLLM for cost tracking
- Database caused a deadlock in the `update_spend` background job
- Every LiteLLM request hung indefinitely
- Three sessions lost to debugging before root cause found
- Fix: removed database entirely. LiteLLM now stateless.
- Learned: never add a database to LiteLLM

### Session 15 — Security Removal + Bug Fix
**What happened**: Discovered serious security CVEs in OpenClaw, removed it. Fixed the EnvironmentFile bug.
- CVEs found: remote code execution, SSH injection, container escape (CVSS 7.8–8.8)
- OpenClaw removed for security reasons
- EnvironmentFile location bug fixed (moved to [Container] section)
- Groq API integration added for free fast cloud models

### Sessions 16–18 — OpenClaw Re-deployment Attempt
**What happened**: Tried re-deploying OpenClaw with security hardening (VPN, firewall, patched version).
- Successfully deployed hardened OpenClaw in Session 18
- Stack was briefly fully operational
- But Groq rate limits discovered as next blocker

### Session 19 — Groq Rate Limit Discovery
**What happened**: Discovered Groq free tier is incompatible with OpenClaw's token usage.
- OpenClaw sends 13,000+ tokens per request
- Groq free tier limits: 6,000–12,000 tokens per minute
- Every interaction failed with 429 rate limit error
- Tried switching models — all too low
- Learned: agent frameworks need far more tokens than free tiers allow

### Session 20 — Stable Baseline Achieved ✅
**What happened**: Removed OpenClaw permanently, declared stable baseline.
- OpenClaw removed (complexity + CVEs + rate limits = not worth it)
- Comprehensive test suite run — all systems verified working
- 7/10 success criteria met
- System declared production-ready
- Next step identified: AnythingLLM as web UI replacement

### Session 21 — AnythingLLM Research + GDM Fix
**Date**: 2026-02-15
**What happened**: Researched AnythingLLM's newer features, planned tutorial, fixed suspend issue.
- Researched AnythingLLM (February 2026): now has MCP support, streaming, real-time URL ingestion
- Compared AnythingLLM vs Claude Projects — both useful, different purposes
- Designed hands-on tutorial plan for AnythingLLM workspaces
- Fixed GDM suspend issue: disabled GDM entirely (headless server doesn't need it)
- Freed ~200-300MB RAM as side benefit
- Next step: Complete the AnythingLLM workspace tutorial

### Session 22 — Logseq + AnythingLLM Workflow Setup
**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Goal**: Rebuild project knowledge base in Logseq, connect to AnythingLLM
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**What happened**:
- Reviewed all project documentation and produced a definitive project overview
- Designed Logseq knowledge base structure for the project
- Created 8 core Logseq pages covering the full project (hub, hardware, architecture, services, commands, decisions, known issues, session log)
- Decided to store Logseq graph on the Samba share (F:\Projects\SilverblueAI\) so AnythingLLM can read files directly
- Configured AnythingLLM to mount the entire Samba share (`/mnt/hdd/share/`) as its hotdir — no manual uploading needed for any project
- Corrected Samba share path throughout documentation (`/mnt/hdd/share/` not `/mnt/hdd/`)
- Updated all affected pages to reflect the automatic sync workflow

**Key decisions**:
- Mount full Samba share (not per-project folders) so new projects require no server changes
- Logseq is the source of truth — AnythingLLM reads from it, not the other way around
- One-time workspace setup per project in AnythingLLM UI; updates sync automatically after that

**Next steps**:
- SSH into server and relaunch AnythingLLM container with the updated volume mounts
- Set up the Silverblue AI Platform workspace in AnythingLLM and assign the Logseq pages
- Test RAG queries against the new knowledge base
