## Ideas to Research Further

- [ ] **Slovenia** — Ljubljana + Lake Bled — heard it's beautiful and affordable
- [ ] **Andalusia road trip** — Seville → Granada → Málaga
- [ ] **Basque Country** — San Sebastián + Bilbao — food scene supposed to be incredible
- [ ] **Madeira** — Malcolm's colleague raved about it, year-round mild weather
- [ ] **Copenhagen** — expensive but looks interesting, good for a long weekend
- [ ] **Valletta, Malta** — history, warm weather, English-speaking

## Trips Ruled Out (and why)

### Paris, France
**Why ruled out:** Been multiple times, feel like we've done it. Would rather explore new places.

### Amsterdam, Netherlands  
**Why ruled out:** Great city but too focused on partying/stag dos for our taste. Could reconsider in quieter season.

### Marrakech, Morocco
**Why ruled out:** Too intense/overwhelming based on friends' experiences. Not our travel style.
